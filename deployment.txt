tried pip freeze for requirements but that didnt work, since it only gave the requirements
which were pip installed in venv. 
so pip installed pipreqs which is supposed to collect all requirements
used in current folder. But that had a bug as well.
So finally figured out that we had to use iso-8859-1 encoding
pipreqs --encoding=iso-8859-1 ./

even encoding=-utf8 didnt work
